# JD-Pickhacks
# Compile the main.py in python3 in terminal to reach the application. Using "IL', "COOK", "CORN"
# will yield a working result. We did not have time to handle null cases / errors - though there
# are a lot so beware. Data was collected from a USDA API, a link to it can be found
# in a comment on ./QSAPIData/cyapi.py. This data was meant to be analzyed to produce a working 
# profit value, but unfortuneately there were still bugs so this data couldn't be pulled out.
# It was close, though, so with additional time it could easily be calculated. One major
# part of this project that unfortunately did not end up showing up was the web scraping aspect.
# We intended to use this over many variables including crop prices, fuel costs, seed costs etc...
# but were unable to get past the JS/CSS. Given more time, this project could be vastly improved.
